# AutoCorrect

A C++ project which reads a word from the user, looks over the English dictionary, and suggests you possible correct spellings for the word you misspelled. Alternative spellings are suggested by checking for different letter arrangements, looking out for extra, missing, or faulty characters using algorithms built from scratch.



## Run on Terminal

```sh
g++ autocorrect.cpp main.cpp -std=c++11 -o test
test
```
